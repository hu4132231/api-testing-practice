# API Testing Practice

This repository is a hands-on practice project for API testing using public REST APIs.

## Purpose
- Practice manual API testing
- Design clear and structured test cases
- Validate response status codes, headers, and bodies
- Get familiar with Postman and basic QA workflows

## API Used
- Reqres API (https://reqres.in)

## Test Cases
- [GET List Users](test-cases/list-users.md) (completed with assertions)
- GET Single User (planned)
- POST Create User (planned)
- Login scenarios (planned)

## Tools
- Postman: Used for sending API requests and validating responses with assertions.
- GitHub: Version control and project hosting.
- Postman collection is included under `/postman` for API request execution and assertions.

## Notes
This project is continuously updated as I practice manual API testing
and improve my test case design skills for Junior QA / Testing Engineer roles.
